Producing official statistics for publications is a key function of many teams across Government. It’s a time consuming and meticulous process to ensure that statistics are accurate and timely. With open source software becoming more widely used, there’s now a range of tools and techniques that can be used to reduce production time, whilst maintaining and even improving the quality of the publications. 

> The Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) is an alternative production methodology for automating the bulk of steps involved in creating a statistical report.
